We don’t just deliver programmes and leave you to it. We encourage you. We challenge you. We help you to get your project or assignment into shape. We get you started on the right lines and we keep in touch. Our lecturers are first class with a wide range of experience including professional, research, industrial and business.<br /> We provide study clinics to help you understand academic issues that might be complicated or holding you back. Students can sometimes run into difficulties during the first year. We believe that by giving you that bit of extra help and support during the first year we can set you on your way. It is very important that you experience success with study and assignments at an early stage. It is in nobody’s interest that you feel down or oppressed about the burden of study. What is studied in first year is continued throughout your programme. Once you get the hang of things and know the study scene you won’t mind asking for help.</td>
